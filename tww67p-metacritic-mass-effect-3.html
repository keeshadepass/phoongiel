What games have had an extremely positive or negative reception at release only for the perception of the game to shift over time? I finally played BioShock Infinite. I played the original game after it was released and thought it was okay, but I didn't love it. BioShock Infinite received near universal acclaim (it still sits at 94% on metacritic) with exceptional praise of it's combat and story. I was going to purchase the game sometime after release, as I usually avoid preordering or buying. For Mass Effect 3 on the Xbox 360, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "94 on Metacritic". Like many people, I’m very passionate about BioWare games. This legendary development studio have created some of the greatest and most memorable stories in the history of the industry, giving us a wonderful Star Wars RPG in Knights of the Old Republic, delving deep into the world of elves, magic, Darkspawn and dragons in the Dragon Age series, and reaching to the stars in the extraordinary Mass Effect series.

Has anyone been playing solo since launch (on your respective platforms) ? What is your take on the game? I'm a casual gamer and rarely play with anyone else (except for The Division which had a strong single player campaign that you could finish on harder difficulties and got you comfortable enough with the game to grind pick-up missions with random players.

There's been a lot of talk about bad sales for 'Deadfire' recently and I have no reason to doubt it based on the willingness to get bought out by Microsoft. THAT SAID: I think 'Deadfire,' for all its flaws, was a really good and enjoyable game. I get the complaints about the story, but I personally loved the setting, which was much more exotic than the traditional fantasy setting in PoE 1. Neketaka is one of my favorite RPG cities ever -- gorgeously designed and executed. The biggest issue. It's becoming all too common for gamers to hold irrational grudges against videogames they haven't played yet and take out their frustrations on Metacritic or Amazon. Hi Everyone, I'm bored at work so I wanted to start a thread. Hopefully we can have some civil discussion. Yesterday we got two pieces of KF content that were very Anthem heavy and it is clear the community and the KF hosts are in disagreement about how this game is performing. In short, I'm confused about the language used by the hosts when discussing the game. I know that Andrea and Fran are fans of the game and they have every right to be and I hope people who enjoy Anthem are enjoying their. 
All right, so the first reviews for Mass Effect 3 have been collected on Metacritic. So far it is looking Here's a list of the notable PS4 games (Note: This sale is for all systems).

With the rise of YouTube and people on the site doing game reviews, game critics like IGN and Gamespot are effectively obsolete. While competition doesn't make you worthless, we tend to trust people who we've followed for a while a bit more than 1 of the 40 game journalists IGN hires.

We need to keep it under the spotlight as often and as long as possible and convince more people to watch. There are a lot of people who would.
