Hi All, Can someone help with me setting og:video meta tag for my wordpress website. So when I share a post with a youtube video in it on facebook, video can be played on facebook. I have uploaded some videos on my youtube channel, and then created blog posts for these videos.

I just want them to be playable within facebook like if you share videos from youtube.

Apologies if this is a newb statement or exists in many places (if it is, I could not find it easily) However, I was irritated as to why Reddit (and other sites) would not pull the image I intended. Reddit (and others) look for tags on the page to tell it which image to pull. Facebook does something similar for how it selects the image of the article in question when there are many images on the page. The submitter often has no control over what image is used, it is up to the web site develope. Hi there! I'm asking to see if it is possible to clear the metadata in this case an erroneously placed og:description for a single linked page in Telegram. To elaborate further, tags such as these are used in place of a metatag description, and can be rather stubborn to change in most social networks. Fortunately Facebook created a development tool to clear said cache from their servers here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug Google's version is here: https://support.google.com/we.
